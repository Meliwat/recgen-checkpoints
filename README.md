# Recursive generalization in Pythia's training checkpoints

Nick Cammarata's essay [Neural Networks Are Already Clean](https://already-clean.goodfire.com/) (Goodfire, 2026-10-15) argues that most neurons which look polysemantic were never packing unrelated concepts together (superposition). Instead they grew by **recursive generalization**: a neuron starts on one pattern and sprouts locally related branches, and those branches sprout their own, so the finished neuron can end up covering things that look unrelated ("iy" → "diy" → "do it yourself").

The essay checks this by watching neurons grow in vision models it trained itself. It says the same can't be done for large language models because their training checkpoints aren't public. [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) publishes 154 checkpoints per model, so this repo runs the test on a language model.

## Setup

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | `EleutherAI/pythia-410m` (24 layers, 4,096 MLP neurons per layer, GeLU) |
| Layer | 12 (middle of the network) |
| Corpus | 4,096 random windows of 512 tokens from [`NeelNanda/pile-10k`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NeelNanda/pile-10k), 2.1M tokens, from the Pile (Pythia's training data) |
| Checkpoints | steps 0, 128, 256, 512, 1k, 2k, 3k, 5k, 8k, 13k, 21k, 34k, 55k, 89k, 143k (final), log-spaced so early training is sampled densely |
| Compute | One M1 Pro laptop. About 5 minutes per checkpoint. |

I used Pythia-410m rather than OLMo-2 1B. Its checkpoints are 0.9 GB instead of 6 GB, and it has log-spaced checkpoints in early training, while OLMo's first is at step 10,000. The cost is that Pythia uses GeLU while Qwen (the essay's main language model) uses SwiGLU.

## Method

1. **Record.** For each checkpoint, run the corpus through layers 0 to 12. Store every neuron's maximum activation in each window, and every activation of the traced neurons. The first 32 positions of each window are ignored, so every example has at least 32 tokens of context.
2. **Select mixed-looking neurons, using the final checkpoint only.** Take each neuron's 50 strongest windows (one example per window). Embed 32 tokens of context up to the activating token with an independent sentence model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), and cluster them (average linkage, cosine distance 0.75). Clusters with 5 or more examples are the neuron's **facets**. Near-dead neurons (peak at or below 1.0) and dense ones (half their peak in over 50% of windows) are skipped. I first tried "30% of peak in over 25% of windows", but at this layer most neurons reach 30% of peak somewhere in 80% of 512-token windows, so only 71 of 4,096 survived. I loosened it after looking at the final checkpoint and before recording any trajectory. The 40 neurons whose two least-related facets are furthest apart are traced. I also read the candidates and hand-picked the ones that look mixed to a human reader, before seeing any trajectory.
3. **Trace.** At every checkpoint, measure each facet's response: the median activation on that facet's exact final-checkpoint examples, divided by the median of the neuron's 50 strongest windows at that checkpoint.

## Rubric

Fixed in [`recgen/rubric.py`](recgen/rubric.py) and committed before any trajectory was recorded.

- A facet is **present** at a checkpoint when its response is at least 0.5.
- A facet **emerges** at the first checkpoint after which it stays present, allowing one dip. It must be present at the final checkpoint.
- Two facets are **adjacent** if either holds:
  - their embedding centroids are more similar than the 75th percentile of similarities between facets of *different* traced neurons, or
  - their most common activating tokens (lowercased, stripped) are equal, or one contains the other (2+ characters).

Each traced neuron gets one label, checked in this order:

| Label | Rule | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| unstable | some facet never emerges | can't say |
| mixed from the start | the earliest-emerging facets aren't connected by a chain of adjacent facets | against a single origin |
| packing-like | some later facet isn't adjacent to any facet that emerged before it | against recursive generalization |
| recursive generalization | every later facet is adjacent to an earlier one | consistent with the essay |
| one origin, timing unresolved | all facets emerge together and are connected | consistent, but the checkpoint grid can't show the order |

**Known bias.** Adjacency only sees relations that a sentence model or a shared token can detect. Relations the network itself might use (the essay's cat/car neuron turned out to be a "V shape" detector) are invisible here. So the rubric leans toward "packing-like" and "mixed from the start." I inspect those cases by hand afterwards, and any links found that way are reported separately; they never change a label.

## Results

### Pre-registered rubric: no recursive generalization, but the test couldn't have found it

| Label | All 40 traced | 23 hand-picked |
|---|---|---|
| recursive generalization | 0 | 0 |
| one origin, timing unresolved | 0 | 0 |
| packing-like | 35 | 19 |
| mixed from the start | 5 | 4 |
| unstable | 0 | 0 |

**Read this as a failed test, not as evidence against the essay.** Selection picked neurons whose two least-related facets have centroid similarity between -0.17 and -0.05 in the sentence model's space. The rubric then counts facets as adjacent only above 0.141 in that same space (or with a shared activating token). In a neuron whose facets are just that unrelated pair, the later facet can't be adjacent to the earlier one, so timing alone decides the label: staggered means "packing-like", simultaneous means "mixed from the start". Recursive generalization was reachable only through a bridging facet in the final top 50 or a shared token, and none turned up. Adjacency should have been judged with a different signal from the one used for selection (see [Next](#next)).

### What the trajectories show (exploratory, not pre-registered)

![Facet responses over training for the 23 hand-picked neurons](results/figures/hand_picked.png)

1. **Facets grow gradually.** None appears in a single jump. At initialization every facet response is below 0.39 (median 0.00), and 95 of the 101 facets emerge between steps 3,000 and 55,000, climbing across several checkpoints.
2. **A neuron's main job drifts in small steps.** From the strongest examples at each checkpoint ([results/trajectories.md](results/trajectories.md)):
   - 3915: "respectively" (step 512) → "though / however" (3k to 8k) → "of course / I admit" (13k) → "Yeah / Sure" (21k on)
   - 2464: "-yl" in chemical names (3k) → "volatile / variability" (8k to 13k) → "tri*ethyl* / tri*alkyl*" (21k on)
   - 1528: "want *that*" (2k to 5k) → "liked / seen" (8k) → "try / see" (13k) → "thought / want" (89k on)

   Each move is to something close by, which fits the essay's picture of local growth.
3. **Unrelated facets arrive separately, with no visible bridge.** In 33 of 40 neurons the two least-related facets emerge at different checkpoints (median gap: 2 checkpoints). Several arrive late: "Mendeleev" in 1528 at 89k, math operators in 1345 at 89k, periods in formulas in 1641 at 89k, closing quotes in dialogue in 2464 at 34k. In the 8 neurons I read checkpoint by checkpoint, none of these late facets showed up among the neuron's strongest examples on the way in, and I found no intermediate step linking them to the main job.
4. **Some neurons are repurposed rather than extended.** Neuron 3282's strongest examples go "bone" → "There / Most" → object nouns ("slows the whole *browser*", "wake up the *device*") → digits inside codes (DOIs, hex, phone numbers). Its "behind her" facet looks like a leftover from the object-noun phase. Neurons 2918 and 2382 show the same kind of replacement. The essay's own InceptionV1 example (5a:178: dome → fire engine → station wagon → dome and arch) has a similar shape.
5. **The largest facet usually doesn't come first.** If unrelated facets were offshoots of a main job, the largest facet should tend to emerge first. It did in 10 of 40 neurons (about 17 expected by chance), tied for first in 9, and came later in 21. One confound: the facet that grew most recently may dominate the final top 50, so "largest" may just mean "newest".

## What this does and doesn't show

- **It doesn't refute recursive generalization.** The pre-registered test was unable to find it. Point 3 is the closest thing here to evidence against it: in this small model, unrelated facets mostly don't arrive through a visible bridge. But that check is me reading the top 4 examples at 15 checkpoints, which can easily miss a branch growing below the top.
- **It supports one part of the essay.** A neuron's main job moves in small, readable steps (point 2).
- **It adds something the essay doesn't discuss.** Repurposing (point 4), where a neuron's main job is replaced and an old job survives as a facet, is a third way to get a mixed-looking neuron besides branching and packing.
- **Weakest part:** facets come from a sentence model. It splits one concept by genre (legal "See" became two facets of neuron 1059) and can't see relations the network might use (the essay's V shape). Both the selection and the adjacency test inherit that.
- **Scope:** one layer of one 410M-parameter model, 40 neurons, 2.1M tokens, 15 checkpoints, GeLU rather than SwiGLU.

## Next

- Judge adjacency with the network's own signal rather than the one used for selection. For example, check whether two facets share upstream neurons (attribution from layer 11), like the essay grouping a neuron's firings "by the circuits that feed them".
- Look for bridges directly. Between a facet's first rise and its emergence, measure the neuron's response to examples near both facets, not just its top examples. Pythia has a checkpoint every 1,000 steps, so the grid can be much denser.
- Repeat on more layers and on OLMo (SwiGLU), to see how common repurposing is.

## v2 results

v2 does the first two items under [Next](#next). It keeps v1's neurons, facets, emergence times and labels, and changes two things: facet adjacency is judged by the network's own upstream drivers instead of the sentence model that selected the neurons, and a bridge search looks for intermediate text at denser checkpoints. Both rules are in [`recgen/rubric_v2.py`](recgen/rubric_v2.py), committed (`76b88ed`) before either was computed on real data. No v1 file or result changed.

### v2 method

1. **Upstream drivers.** Pythia's blocks are parallel, so a layer-12 neuron's pre-activation is an exact sum of direct terms from the token embedding, each earlier attention layer, and each of the 49,152 MLP neurons in layers 0 to 11, once the LayerNorm scale is frozen at its value on each example. On the real model the terms add back up to the pre-activation within 5e-5. For each facet I average every upstream MLP neuron's term over the facet's final-checkpoint examples, subtract its average on 1,024 random text positions, and keep the 100 largest positive ones. Those are the facet's drivers.
2. **Adjacency.** Two facets are adjacent if their drivers overlap more than the 95th percentile of the neuron's null. The null is this neuron's facets against the facets of the other 39 traced neurons, all read through this neuron's weights, so sharing the neuron's own input weights can't by itself make two facets look adjacent.
3. **Bridge search.** For each later facet B and each facet A that emerged before it (69 pairs), the bridge is the 50 texts most similar to both, out of a pool of 491,520 random positions (sentence model, one text per window). I recorded pre-activations at 29 checkpoints from step 512 to 89k: v1's plus up to 3 more between each pair on Pythia's 1,000-step grid. The bridge's B-ward gain is its median pre-activation minus that of text matched on similarity to A but unlike B. A bridge **leads** if its gain passes half its level at B's emergence at least 2 checkpoints before B's own gain does, and that level is at least 20% of B's own gain then. A placebo (text matched on similarity to B but unlike A) gets the same test and should rise with B either way.

### What changed

| Label | v1, all 40 | v2, all 40 | v1, 23 hand-picked | v2, 23 hand-picked |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| recursive generalization | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 |
| one origin, timing unresolved | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| packing-like | 35 | 32 | 19 | 19 |
| mixed from the start | 5 | 6 | 4 | 4 |
| unstable | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |

![Upstream driver overlap between facets, against its null and ceiling](results/figures/v2_driver_overlaps.png)

1. **The network's own drivers mostly agree with the sentence model.** Two random halves of one facet share a median 42% of their drivers, so the signature is stable enough to test. A facet and another neuron's facet share 2%. Facet pairs that v1 called unrelated also share 2%, while pairs v1 called related (such as neuron 3370's two "Sure" facets, 86%) share a median 45%. The two versions agree on 78 of 86 facet pairs. Fixing v1's circularity didn't uncover hidden adjacency: facets that look unrelated to a reader are also driven by different upstream neurons.
2. **Two neurons become recursive generalization, about what chance predicts.** If facet pairs were adjacent only at the null's false-positive rate (median 4.5% per pair), 0.9 such labels would be expected. Neuron 2976 is the interesting one: its facets are mid-word pieces of unusual words in three scripts (CJK byte fragments, "T*iss*ington" in British place names, Turkish "ç"), which looks like a single job that a sentence model can't see. Neuron 4010 (scientific vs legal citations) is weaker: two random halves of its facet 0 share only 8% of their drivers, so that facet's signature is mostly noise. Neuron 1228 moves from packing-like to mixed from the start.
3. **Sensitivity.** With top 25, 50 or 200 drivers instead of 100, 1 to 3 neurons are labeled recursive generalization. With v1's 75th percentile instead of the 95th, it's 5 to 10, but that cutoff counts a quarter of unrelated pairs as adjacent by construction.
4. **The bridge search found no leading bridge, but it had little chance to.** None of the 51 later facets has one, and 67 of 69 pairs show no bridge response at all. The placebo didn't pass either: text as similar to B as the bridge is, but unlike A, reached a median 4.8% of B's own gain (bridge: 3.7%, and above the placebo in 33 of 69 pairs, a coin flip). Text that a sentence model puts near a facet barely drives these neurons compared with the facet's own examples, so a 20% floor was out of reach for any matched text. What the search does show is that in these 29 checkpoints, nothing a sentence model sees as between two unrelated facets drove the neuron on the way. ([all pairs](results/figures/v2_bridges_all.png), [hand-picked](results/figures/v2_bridges_hand_picked.png), [gain shares](results/figures/v2_bridge_gain_shares.png))
5. **Facets arrive earlier in pre-activation than v1's threshold shows** (exploratory). When the earlier facet of a pair emerges, the later facet's examples already have a median 72% of the pre-activation gain they have at their own emergence. Timing each facet by where its gain passes half its step-89k value, v1's order holds in 49 of the 69 staggered pairs, ties in 10 and reverses in 10. Late arrivals from v1 point 3 were building for most of training: "Mendeleev" in 1528 emerges at 89k under v1 but is half-way by 17k, and 2976's facets (8k, 21k, 34k under v1) are half-way by 2k, 4k and 4k. GELU and the 0.5 cutoff make arrivals look later and more separate than the drive behind them. That weakens the timing half of both versions' labels, which decides between packing-like and mixed from the start.

### What's still shaky

- **Drivers cover a minority of the input.** Upstream MLP neurons carry a median 25% of a facet's rise over random text. The rest comes through attention and the token embedding, which v2 doesn't compare, and indirect paths (an early neuron acting through later ones) are left out.
- **Adjacency is judged at the final checkpoint.** Two facets that branched from a shared circuit and later separated would look unrelated now. Comparing drivers at the later facet's emergence checkpoint would test that directly.
- **The bridge test is underpowered** (point 4), and its texts are only weakly between facets: a median similarity of 0.24 to each, against 0.68 for a facet's own examples to its centroid. When two facets are unrelated, the 491,520-text pool holds little that is close to both.
- **The null is strict for same-genre facets.** Many traced facets come from the same few genres (legal, fiction, travel guides), so the null's upper tail includes same-genre pairs and the 95th-percentile threshold ranges from 0.05 to 0.15 by neuron.
- **Scope is unchanged:** one layer of one model, 40 neurons selected with the sentence model.

`run_v2.sh` needs v1's `results/` and `data/corpus.npy`. From scratch it takes about 2 hours on an M1 Pro: it downloads the final checkpoint once and 29 more one at a time, deleting each after use, and caches 1.6 GB in `data/`. With that cache, it reruns in a few minutes.

## v3 results

v1 and v2 looked only at the input side: what makes each neuron fire. The essay's core argument is about the output side: the cat/car neuron is one "V-shape" distinction, and the rest of the network reads it the same way whichever object set it off. v3 checks the output side of the same 40 neurons at the final checkpoint. On each facet, does the neuron's firing help predict the next token, and does the network do the same thing with it on each facet? The rules are in [`recgen/rubric_v3.py`](recgen/rubric_v3.py), committed (`815a088`) before any output was computed on facet data. No v1 or v2 file or result changed.

| Picture | What the output side should show |
|---|---|
| **one job**, unrelated triggers (the essay's V shape) | the neuron helps on both facets, and the network does the same thing with it on each |
| **one use + interference** (superposition's interference) | it helps on one facet; on the other, removing it changes nothing (harmless) or helps (harmful) |
| **two uses** sharing a neuron | it helps on both, but the network does different things with it on each |

### v3 method

1. **Bigger facets.** v1's facets have 5 to 26 examples, too few to test one at a time. Each facet keeps its examples and takes more from the neuron's strongest windows at the final checkpoint (one example per window, down to half the neuron's top-50 level, at most 2,000 windows). A window joins the facet whose v1 centroid it is most similar to in the sentence model's space, if that similarity is at least 0.4, most similar first, up to 40 per facet. I set 0.4 after looking at the facet sizes it gives and reading some borderline additions (input side only), before computing any output. The 101 facets now have 7 to 40 examples (median 40), 3,127 in all, 690 of them from v1.
2. **Help.** At each example, zero-ablate the neuron at that position only and compare the log-prob of the actual next token. Help is "as is" minus "ablated", in nats. A facet **helps** if its median help is at least 0.01 and a Wilcoxon signed-rank test gives p < 0.05, **harms** if the median is at most -0.01 with p < 0.05, and is **harmless** otherwise.
3. **What the network does with it.** A facet's signature is the change in next-token log-probs over the whole vocabulary, centered (so it's the change in logits), averaged over the facet's examples. All facets share the neuron's output weights, so their signatures look alike by construction. The control: patch the neuron to its facet-typical activation at 1,024 random text positions. The mean change there is its **generic push**. A facet's **specific signature** is its signature with the generic push projected out: what the network does with the neuron on that facet beyond what it does anywhere. Its **reliability** is how well two random halves of the facet agree on it (stepped up to the full facet with Spearman-Brown), the split-half ceiling. The **shared-job score** of two facets is the cosine of their specific signatures divided by the square root of the product of their reliabilities, the usual correction for noise: about 1 if they share one job, about 0 if their jobs are unrelated. On simulated facets with unrelated jobs, raw signatures have cosine 0.87 to 0.90, while this score stays within 0.03 of zero ([`tests/test_rubric_v3.py`](tests/test_rubric_v3.py)).
4. **Labels**, per facet pair: **too few examples** if either facet has fewer than 10. Otherwise, by each facet's help: both help gives **one job** (score 0.5 or more), **two uses** (below 0.5), or **no reliable specific signature** (either reliability below 0.5); one helps gives **one use + harmless** or **+ harmful interference**; neither helps gives **no use found**. A neuron's label is that of its two least-related facets, the pair that got it selected.

Reported next to the labels: mean-ablation instead of zero, a help floor of 0 or 0.03, and a 0.5 similarity cutoff for added examples. Exploratory: help on the 4 predictions after the next one, a positive control (facet pairs v1 and v2 both call related, such as one concept split in two), and a negative control (each neuron patched into the other neurons' facets, contexts it shouldn't share a job with).

### What v3 found

| v3 label (least-related pair) | All 40 | 23 hand-picked |
|---|---|---|
| one job | 0 | 0 |
| both help, no reliable specific signature | 0 | 0 |
| two uses | 0 | 0 |
| one use + harmless interference | 0 | 0 |
| one use + harmful interference | 0 | 0 |
| no use found | 37 | 22 |
| too few examples | 3 | 1 |

Side by side with v1 and v2 ([per neuron](results/v3_neurons.md)): all 40 are "no use found" except 3068, 138 and 2346 (packing-like in v1 and v2), whose least-related pair has a facet with under 10 examples. That covers all of v1's labels (35 packing-like, 5 mixed from the start) and both neurons v2 called recursive generalization (2976, 4010).

![Shared-job scores against the controls](results/figures/v3_shared_job.png)

1. **The pre-registered test can't tell the three pictures apart, because on their strongest examples these neurons don't measurably help predict the next token.** No facet helps; 99 of 101 are harmless and 2 harm. Per example, ablation moves the actual next token's log-prob by a median 0.011 nats, up or down: 49% of examples go up, the mean is 0.0001 nats, and the direction is unrelated to whether the model was right (Spearman -0.004 with its log-prob). The next 4 predictions show the same: every facet that is harmless on the next token is harmless there too. Mean-ablation and a 0.03 floor give identical labels. With no floor, 5 neurons get an interference label on helps of 0.0001 to 0.007 nats, and none gets one job or two uses. ([help per neuron](results/figures/v3_primary_help.png), [labels](results/figures/v3_labels.png))
2. **Where a neuron fires most, it barely changes the prediction, and no more than in random text** (exploratory, added after seeing point 1). On a facet, ablation moves a median 1.0% of next-token probability (KL 0.0004 nats). Patched to the same activation in random text, the neuron moves 1.0% (KL 0.0004). Only 44 of 95 facets with 10 or more examples are above their random-text level.
3. **What the network does with a neuron is consistent within a facet and unrelated across unrelated facets.** The raw signatures of a neuron's two least-related facets have cosine 0.39 (median): the shared-weights effect. Beyond the generic push (a median 39% of a signature's squared norm), two halves of one facet agree well (reliability median 0.81). Facet pairs v1 and v2 both call related, like 1059's two legal "See" facets, score a median 0.86, and 10 of 12 pass 0.5. The 36 least-related pairs whose facets are both reliable score a median -0.006, and none passes 0.5; the highest is 2976 at 0.42. That is where unrelated contexts sit: a neuron's facets against other neurons' facets, with the neuron patched in there, score a median 0.03, and 2.4% of those pairs pass 0.5. So at the output, what the network does with the neuron follows the context the neuron fires in.

### Reading cases by hand

These readings are separate from the labels. They use the tokens whose probability the neuron raises and lowers most on each facet (listed for every neuron in [results/v3_neurons.md](results/v3_neurons.md)).

- **1059, legal "See" vs price and time ranges.** After "See" it raises the start of a cited case ("People", "United", "id", "Id") and lowers "Rule", "also", "supra" and commas: cite a case, not a rule or statute. In ranges like "5-10pm" it reshuffles which number or day comes next ("4", "9", "10", "Tue" up; "5", "6", "8", "Mon" down) with no clear direction. Two different jobs, both small (1.5% and 1.1% of probability moved).
- **3282, phone numbers vs "behind her".** In phone numbers it raises single digits and lowers "00", "0" and "-": how the number continues. After "behind her" or "in front of her" it raises ".", "," and "and" and lowers "mood", "face" and "bed": it reads "her" as an object that ends the phrase, not a possessive ("her mood"). Two readable, unrelated jobs. It helps slightly on "her" (median +0.004 nats, under the floor).
- **1528, "Mendeleev" vs "See you".** On "M|ende" it raises "ley", "'s" and "," and lowers "le" and "lev", the correct next piece. This is the clearest harmful interference in the set: median help -0.03 nats (p < 0.001), KL ten times its random-text level. In dialogue it does almost nothing. For this facet the superposition picture fits: a neuron whose main job is elsewhere (v1's trajectory: "want / that" to "thought / want") fires on "Mendeleev" and gets in the way. It isn't labeled harmful interference because no facet helps.
- **2976, mid-word pieces in Chinese and Japanese, British place names, and Turkish.** On all three it raises plausible continuations of a word split into rare pieces ("った" and "ア" in Japanese; "inia" and "ichen" in place names; "men", "inc" and "en" in Turkish). It has the highest least-related score (0.42), its Turkish facet has the largest help in the set (median +0.05 nats, but p = 0.07 with 19 examples), and v2 called it recursive generalization from its upstream drivers. It's the one candidate for "one job, unrelated triggers" here, though no facet passes the help test.
- Two of the next-highest scores belong to the hand-picked neurons I had flagged for a possible shared pattern. 2918 (section signs vs pound signs) raises digits on both facets (score 0.23; its pound-sign facet harms, pushing prices like "25", "45" and "15"), and 2442 (commands in dialogue vs "stir" in recipes) raises what follows an imperative verb, objects on one and prepositions ("for", "until", "into") on the other (0.28).

### What this does and doesn't show

- **It doesn't decide between the three pictures.** The pre-registered labels hinge on help, and single-neuron ablation at the strongest examples has no consistent effect on the next tokens. The test couldn't tell one job, interference and two uses apart, so it's no evidence for or against any of them.
- **It shows the network's response to a neuron follows the context.** Unrelated facets get unrelated output signatures, as unrelated contexts do. But this isn't evidence against the essay. In its picture, a V shape read by cat features in cat images and car features in car images also changes the output differently in each. Different final effects count against "one distinction read downstream" only if the first readers differ too. The test that can decide it is which later components read the neuron on each facet: the downstream mirror of v2's upstream drivers.
- **Two cases point opposite ways.** 1528's "Mendeleev" facet looks like interference. 2976 looks like one job in three scripts, which v2's drivers also suggested.

### What's still shaky

- **Single-neuron ablation is a weak probe here.** One neuron moves about 1% of next-token probability. If other neurons carry the same signal, removing one can hide a real use. Ablating a facet's co-firing neurons together, or patching paths to specific later components, would be stronger.
- **Logit-space signatures are dominated by improbable tokens.** The top tokens of a specific signature are fragments like "EVER" and "osis" that barely matter for prediction. The probability view (point 2 and the hand readings) fixes that, but it was added after seeing the results and isn't calibrated against a negative control.
- **Only the next 5 predictions are measured.** A neuron's write at one position can be read much later.
- **Bigger facets drift a little.** 2976's Turkish facet picks up Hindi and code, and 1059's price facet picks up street names. With a 0.5 cutoff instead of 0.4, 16 neurons drop to too few examples and the other 24 stay "no use found".
- **The negative control is rougher than the main test.** Other neurons' facets are split once (even and odd examples) for their reliability, instead of 50 random splits.
- **Two harmful facets out of 101 is no more than chance gives** at p < 0.05, except that 1528's is far from chance.
- **Scope is unchanged:** one layer of one model, 40 neurons selected with the sentence model, final checkpoint only.

### v3 files and reproduce

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`recgen/rubric_v3.py`](recgen/rubric_v3.py) | Pre-registered facet enlargement, measures and labels |
| [`results/facets_v3.json`](results/facets_v3.json) | The enlarged facets: window, position, activation, similarity, whether v1 had it |
| [`results/classification_v3.json`](results/classification_v3.json) | v1, v2 and v3 labels; per-facet help, reliability, top tokens; per-pair scores; sensitivity; controls |
| [`results/v3_neurons.md`](results/v3_neurons.md) | Per neuron: a summary table, then each facet's help, top tokens and examples, and each pair's score |
| [`results/figures/`](results/figures/) `v3_*.png` | Shared-job scores against the controls, help on each least-related pair, label counts |

```bash
./run_v3.sh
```

`run_v3.sh` needs v1's `results/` and `data/` and v2's `results/classification_v2.json`. From scratch it takes about an hour on an M1 Pro: it downloads the final checkpoint once, deletes it after use, and caches 0.9 GB in `data/`. With that cache, it reruns in 30 seconds and gives identical results.

## Files

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| [`results/candidates.md`](results/candidates.md) | The 40 traced neurons and their facets at the final checkpoint |
| [`results/hand_picked.json`](results/hand_picked.json) | The 23 hand-picked neurons, with why each looks mixed |
| [`results/classification.json`](results/classification.json) | Labels, emergence steps, facet similarities, exploratory stats |
| [`results/trajectories.md`](results/trajectories.md) | Each hand-picked neuron's strongest examples at every checkpoint |
| [`results/figures/`](results/figures/) | Facet response curves (hand-picked and all traced) and label counts |

## Reproduce

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` takes about 2 hours on an M1 Pro. It downloads 15 checkpoints of about 1.6 GB each, one at a time, and deletes each after use. Recorded activations (about 2.5 GB) go to `data/`, which isn't committed.
