# Recursive generalization in Pythia's training checkpoints

Nick Cammarata's essay [Neural Networks Are Already Clean](https://already-clean.goodfire.com/) (Goodfire, 2026-10-15) argues that most neurons which look polysemantic were never packing unrelated concepts together (superposition). Instead they grew by **recursive generalization**: a neuron starts on one pattern and sprouts locally related branches, and those branches sprout their own, so the finished neuron can end up covering things that look unrelated ("iy" → "diy" → "do it yourself").

The essay checks this by watching neurons grow in vision models it trained itself. It says the same can't be done for large language models because their training checkpoints aren't public. [Pythia](https://github.com/EleutherAI/pythia) publishes 154 checkpoints per model, so this repo runs the test on a language model.

## Setup

| | |
|---|---|
| Model | `EleutherAI/pythia-410m` (24 layers, 4,096 MLP neurons per layer, GeLU) |
| Layer | 12 (middle of the network) |
| Corpus | 4,096 random windows of 512 tokens from [`NeelNanda/pile-10k`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/NeelNanda/pile-10k), 2.1M tokens, from the Pile (Pythia's training data) |
| Checkpoints | steps 0, 128, 256, 512, 1k, 2k, 3k, 5k, 8k, 13k, 21k, 34k, 55k, 89k, 143k (final), log-spaced so early training is sampled densely |
| Compute | One M1 Pro laptop. About 5 minutes per checkpoint. |

I used Pythia-410m rather than OLMo-2 1B. Its checkpoints are 0.9 GB instead of 6 GB, and it has log-spaced checkpoints in early training, while OLMo's first is at step 10,000. The cost is that Pythia uses GeLU while Qwen (the essay's main language model) uses SwiGLU.

## Method

1. **Record.** For each checkpoint, run the corpus through layers 0 to 12. Store every neuron's maximum activation in each window, and every activation of the traced neurons. The first 32 positions of each window are ignored, so every example has at least 32 tokens of context.
2. **Select mixed-looking neurons, using the final checkpoint only.** Take each neuron's 50 strongest windows (one example per window). Embed 32 tokens of context up to the activating token with an independent sentence model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), and cluster them (average linkage, cosine distance 0.75). Clusters with 5 or more examples are the neuron's **facets**. Near-dead neurons (peak at or below 1.0) and dense ones (half their peak in over 50% of windows) are skipped. I first tried "30% of peak in over 25% of windows", but at this layer most neurons reach 30% of peak somewhere in 80% of 512-token windows, so only 71 of 4,096 survived. I loosened it after looking at the final checkpoint and before recording any trajectory. The 40 neurons whose two least-related facets are furthest apart are traced. I also read the candidates and hand-picked the ones that look mixed to a human reader, before seeing any trajectory.
3. **Trace.** At every checkpoint, measure each facet's response: the median activation on that facet's exact final-checkpoint examples, divided by the median of the neuron's 50 strongest windows at that checkpoint.

## Rubric

Fixed in [`recgen/rubric.py`](recgen/rubric.py) and committed before any trajectory was recorded.

- A facet is **present** at a checkpoint when its response is at least 0.5.
- A facet **emerges** at the first checkpoint after which it stays present, allowing one dip. It must be present at the final checkpoint.
- Two facets are **adjacent** if either holds:
  - their embedding centroids are more similar than the 75th percentile of similarities between facets of *different* traced neurons, or
  - their most common activating tokens (lowercased, stripped) are equal, or one contains the other (2+ characters).

Each traced neuron gets one label, checked in this order:

| Label | Rule | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| unstable | some facet never emerges | can't say |
| mixed from the start | the earliest-emerging facets aren't connected by a chain of adjacent facets | against a single origin |
| packing-like | some later facet isn't adjacent to any facet that emerged before it | against recursive generalization |
| recursive generalization | every later facet is adjacent to an earlier one | consistent with the essay |
| one origin, timing unresolved | all facets emerge together and are connected | consistent, but the checkpoint grid can't show the order |

**Known bias.** Adjacency only sees relations that a sentence model or a shared token can detect. Relations the network itself might use (the essay's cat/car neuron turned out to be a "V shape" detector) are invisible here. So the rubric leans toward "packing-like" and "mixed from the start." I inspect those cases by hand afterwards, and any links found that way are reported separately; they never change a label.

## Results

### Pre-registered rubric: no recursive generalization, but the test couldn't have found it

| Label | All 40 traced | 23 hand-picked |
|---|---|---|
| recursive generalization | 0 | 0 |
| one origin, timing unresolved | 0 | 0 |
| packing-like | 35 | 19 |
| mixed from the start | 5 | 4 |
| unstable | 0 | 0 |

**Read this as a failed test, not as evidence against the essay.** Selection picked neurons whose two least-related facets have centroid similarity between -0.17 and -0.05 in the sentence model's space. The rubric then counts facets as adjacent only above 0.141 in that same space (or with a shared activating token). In a neuron whose facets are just that unrelated pair, the later facet can't be adjacent to the earlier one, so timing alone decides the label: staggered means "packing-like", simultaneous means "mixed from the start". Recursive generalization was reachable only through a bridging facet in the final top 50 or a shared token, and none turned up. Adjacency should have been judged with a different signal from the one used for selection (see [Next](#next)).

### What the trajectories show (exploratory, not pre-registered)

![Facet responses over training for the 23 hand-picked neurons](results/figures/hand_picked.png)

1. **Facets grow gradually.** None appears in a single jump. At initialization every facet response is below 0.39 (median 0.00), and 95 of the 101 facets emerge between steps 3,000 and 55,000, climbing across several checkpoints.
2. **A neuron's main job drifts in small steps.** From the strongest examples at each checkpoint ([results/trajectories.md](results/trajectories.md)):
   - 3915: "respectively" (step 512) → "though / however" (3k to 8k) → "of course / I admit" (13k) → "Yeah / Sure" (21k on)
   - 2464: "-yl" in chemical names (3k) → "volatile / variability" (8k to 13k) → "tri*ethyl* / tri*alkyl*" (21k on)
   - 1528: "want *that*" (2k to 5k) → "liked / seen" (8k) → "try / see" (13k) → "thought / want" (89k on)

   Each move is to something close by, which fits the essay's picture of local growth.
3. **Unrelated facets arrive separately, with no visible bridge.** In 33 of 40 neurons the two least-related facets emerge at different checkpoints (median gap: 2 checkpoints). Several arrive late: "Mendeleev" in 1528 at 89k, math operators in 1345 at 89k, periods in formulas in 1641 at 89k, closing quotes in dialogue in 2464 at 34k. In the 8 neurons I read checkpoint by checkpoint, none of these late facets showed up among the neuron's strongest examples on the way in, and I found no intermediate step linking them to the main job.
4. **Some neurons are repurposed rather than extended.** Neuron 3282's strongest examples go "bone" → "There / Most" → object nouns ("slows the whole *browser*", "wake up the *device*") → digits inside codes (DOIs, hex, phone numbers). Its "behind her" facet looks like a leftover from the object-noun phase. Neurons 2918 and 2382 show the same kind of replacement. The essay's own InceptionV1 example (5a:178: dome → fire engine → station wagon → dome and arch) has a similar shape.
5. **The largest facet usually doesn't come first.** If unrelated facets were offshoots of a main job, the largest facet should tend to emerge first. It did in 10 of 40 neurons (about 17 expected by chance), tied for first in 9, and came later in 21. One confound: the facet that grew most recently may dominate the final top 50, so "largest" may just mean "newest".

## What this does and doesn't show

- **It doesn't refute recursive generalization.** The pre-registered test was unable to find it. Point 3 is the closest thing here to evidence against it: in this small model, unrelated facets mostly don't arrive through a visible bridge. But that check is me reading the top 4 examples at 15 checkpoints, which can easily miss a branch growing below the top.
- **It supports one part of the essay.** A neuron's main job moves in small, readable steps (point 2).
- **It adds something the essay doesn't discuss.** Repurposing (point 4), where a neuron's main job is replaced and an old job survives as a facet, is a third way to get a mixed-looking neuron besides branching and packing.
- **Weakest part:** facets come from a sentence model. It splits one concept by genre (legal "See" became two facets of neuron 1059) and can't see relations the network might use (the essay's V shape). Both the selection and the adjacency test inherit that.
- **Scope:** one layer of one 410M-parameter model, 40 neurons, 2.1M tokens, 15 checkpoints, GeLU rather than SwiGLU.

## Next

- Judge adjacency with the network's own signal rather than the one used for selection. For example, check whether two facets share upstream neurons (attribution from layer 11), like the essay grouping a neuron's firings "by the circuits that feed them".
- Look for bridges directly. Between a facet's first rise and its emergence, measure the neuron's response to examples near both facets, not just its top examples. Pythia has a checkpoint every 1,000 steps, so the grid can be much denser.
- Repeat on more layers and on OLMo (SwiGLU), to see how common repurposing is.

## Reproduce

```bash
uv sync
uv run pytest
./run.sh
```

`run.sh` takes about 2 hours on an M1 Pro. It downloads 15 checkpoints of about 1.6 GB each, one at a time, and deletes each after use. Recorded activations (about 2.5 GB) go to `data/`, which isn't committed.
